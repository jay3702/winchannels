### 2026-04-17 - Progress bar on Recent Recordings detail pane

- Request: show playback progress bar on the detail pane after selecting a recording from the Recent Recordings list, matching the list row behavior.
- Rationale: users expect to see resume progress consistently, not just in the list view.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - progress bar was visible in the Recent Recordings list but missing from the detail pane
- Solution:
  - added the same progress bar logic to the detail pane for in-progress, unwatched items
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean; production build run after update
# Engineering Journal

This file adds the decision context that is usually missing from commit messages and GitHub activity history. Entries should stay concise and focus on why a change was made, what symptoms were observed, and how the solution was validated.

## Unreleased

### 2026-04-26 - Local bug report composer with persistent 48-hour client error log

- Request: replace the GitHub-dependent report flow with a local bug report composer suitable for Channels Community posts, and include a persistent client-side error log that retains the last 48 hours.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - the prior `Open Bug Report` and `Open Feature Request` actions assumed GitHub authentication.
  - users had no persistent client log to include alongside server diagnostics when posting to the forum.
- Solution:
  - added `src/lib/clientErrorLog.ts` to persist client-side error entries in localStorage, prune entries older than 48 hours, and capture `console.error`, `window.error`, and `unhandledrejection` events.
  - `main.tsx`: installs client error logging at startup so errors persist across app restarts.
  - `Settings.tsx`: replaced GitHub issue links with a single `Open Bug Report` action that opens a local editor prefilled with environment details, latest Test Connection output, and the fenced client error log ready for Channels Community.
  - `Page.css`: added bug-report composer modal and textarea styling consistent with the existing app modal pattern.
- Validation:
  - Production build completed successfully.

### 2026-04-25 - Reusable report template workflow for bug/feature requests

- Request: add a report template that can be used for any bug or feature request and direct users to use it when API compatibility shows unapproved versions.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - users had no guided way to package diagnostics for compatibility mismatches.
  - incompatibility warnings lacked a direct action path for reporting findings.
- Solution:
  - `Settings.tsx`: added a `Report Template` section with:
    - `Copy Report Template` (clipboard)
    - `Open Bug Report` (prefilled GitHub issue)
    - `Open Feature Request` (prefilled GitHub issue)
  - Template now includes app version, active server info, detected internal/public API versions, compatibility state, and latest Test Connection output.
  - API Compatibility warning now explicitly directs users to use the report template when the detected version is not approved.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified file.
  - Production build completed successfully.

### 2026-04-25 - Repository-hosted API compatibility approvals (server + public API versions)

- Request: move compatibility approvals from client-local state to the repository, track both server and public API version numbers, keep warnings non-blocking, and improve confusing compatibility messaging.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - local per-server approval wording (`not yet approved for this server`) was confusing.
  - API Compatibility section could still show `Connect to a server first` even after Test Connection checks.
  - write actions were blocked on version mismatch, conflicting with desired warn-only policy.
- Solution:
  - Added `.github/api-version-compatibility.json` as a repository-managed approval matrix with entries for `serverVersion`, optional `publicApiVersion`, and `approved`.
  - `client.ts`: added status parsing for both internal server version and public API version; added repository matrix fetch and version-pair approval matcher.
  - `useStore.ts`: replaced localStorage approval logic with repository matrix checks; now stores detected `apiVersion` + `apiPublicVersion` and a compatibility note.
  - `Settings.tsx`: Test Connection now evaluates versions against repository approvals and reports clearer per-server results (`approved in repository`, `not approved in repository yet`, or approvals unavailable).
  - `Settings.tsx`: API Compatibility messaging updated to clarify active-server detection and repository approval status; About section now also shows newer client version notice with releases link.
  - `Movies.tsx`, `RecentRecordings.tsx`, `TVShows.tsx`: removed hard mutation blocks on unapproved version; behavior is warning-only.
  - `App.tsx`: updated top warning banner copy to reflect non-blocking caution.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified files.
  - Production build completed successfully after removing an unused selector.

### 2026-04-25 - Test Connection now reports per-server API compatibility

- Request: make the Settings `Test Connection` button check API version on each configured server and report compatibility problems individually.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - Connection test only reported endpoint reachability/counts and did not evaluate API version compatibility per server.
  - Users with multiple servers needed server-by-server confirmation of version approval mismatches.
- Solution:
  - `Settings.tsx`: added per-server `/api/v1/status` checks during Test Connection.
  - Extracted reported API version (`version`/`Version`/`build`) and compared it to the stored approved version for each server id.
  - Output now shows one of: approved version, not-yet-approved version, version mismatch, or missing version field for each server.
  - Test summary now includes total compatibility issue count in addition to reachability.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified file.

### 2026-04-25 - Status endpoint fallback for API version detection

- Request: user reported Test Connection showing `0/N reachable` due to `404 GET /api/v1/status` on otherwise reachable servers.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - Test Connection grouped `/api/v1/status` into the same `Promise.all` as episodes/movies/shows, so a status 404 failed the entire server connectivity check.
  - Version detection and probe logic assumed `/api/v1/status` existed on all server variants.
- Solution:
  - `Settings.tsx`: decoupled connectivity checks from version checks; reachability now comes from content endpoints, while version uses `fetchServerVersion` separately.
  - `client.ts`: added status endpoint fallback candidates (`/api/v1/status`, `/api/status`, `/status`) for both probe and version detection.
  - Compatibility output now flags undetected version as a per-server compatibility warning rather than reporting the server as unreachable.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified files.
  - Production build completed successfully.

### 2026-04-25 - API compatibility probe reliability across multi-port servers

- Request: investigate odd API compatibility behavior reported on a setup with multiple DVR servers sharing one IP but using different ports.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - API compatibility probe in `App.tsx` only reran when `activeServerId` changed.
  - Editing active server URL/port could leave compatibility state stale (`Version not yet detected` or prior value) until a full server switch/restart.
  - Async probe completion could apply version results to the wrong active server if selection changed during the request.
- Solution:
  - `App.tsx`: made startup/server probe effect depend on both `activeServerId` and `serverChangeVersion` so URL/port edits trigger a fresh version probe.
  - `useStore.ts`: captured probe target server id, ignored stale async results when active server changed mid-probe, and reset compatibility state when detection fails or server context changes.
  - `useStore.ts`: reset `apiVersion`/`apiVersionApproved` on active server change and server URL updates to avoid stale display.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified files (`App.tsx`, `useStore.ts`).

### 2026-04-24 - Startup check for newer WinChannels release

- Request: check on startup whether a newer app version exists.
- Rationale: users should see available updates proactively instead of manually checking GitHub releases.
- Solution:
  - `App.tsx`: added a one-time startup check against GitHub Releases (`/repos/jay3702/winchannels/releases/latest`).
  - Added semantic version comparison logic so only newer versions trigger a notice.
  - Added a top-of-app update banner with latest version and a direct release link.
  - Guarded the check with a ref so React StrictMode does not duplicate requests in development.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified files.

### 2026-04-23 - TV Shows default sort set to Last Recorded

- Request: make Last Recorded the default sort in the TV show list.
- Rationale: users expect the most recently recorded shows to surface first without changing sort controls.
- Solution:
  - `TVShows.tsx`: changed initial and fallback show sort defaults from `title` to `last-recorded`.
  - Sort direction default remains field-based, so `last-recorded` defaults to descending.
  - Existing persisted sort selections remain intact; the new default applies when no saved TV show sort state exists.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified file.

### 2026-04-23 - TV Shows list sort by last_recorded_at

- Request: add a TV show list sort option for `last_recorded_at`.
- Rationale: users want to prioritize shows by most recently recorded activity rather than created/updated metadata.
- Solution:
  - `TVShows.tsx`: added a show-list sort field `last-recorded`, wired to `Show.last_recorded_at`, and exposed it in the TV show sort dropdown as `Last Recorded`.
  - Kept episode sort fields unchanged to avoid introducing an unsupported `last-recorded` mode where episode data does not provide that key.
  - Updated sort-state parsing/validation to persist and restore the new show sort field safely.
  - `types.ts`: added optional `last_recorded_at?: number` to `Show`.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified files.

### 2026-04-23 - Progressive list auto-fill loop: missing scrollbar when content fits

- Request: user reported no scrollbar in Recent Recordings list despite seeing 5 recordings and "Scroll for more recordings" message.
- Symptoms: `rec-list__items` had `overflow-y: auto` but no scrollbar; the "Scroll for older recordings…" sentinel was visible, meaning more groups existed, but there was nothing to scroll.
- Root cause: the scroll `useEffect` depended only on `[groups.length]`. On mount it called `handleScroll()` once, which expanded from 3 → 5 day groups (step = 2). After that one expansion the effect did not re-run, so if the 5 groups' content still fit within the container height without overflowing, the scrollbar never appeared and the user had no way to trigger further expansion.
- Solution: added the visible-count state variable (`visibleDayGroups`, `visibleChannelCount`, `visibleMovieCount`, `visibleShowCount`) to the scroll effect's dependency array in all four pages. Now each expansion triggers a re-run of the effect which calls `handleScroll()` again, continuing to fill until either overflow exists or all items are shown. The `current >= total` guard already prevents infinite expansion.
- Validation: TypeScript diagnostics clean for all modified files; pushed as v1.3.3.

### 2026-04-23 - Fix CI build failure: unused recordings state variable

- Request: CI builds failed on all four platform targets after v1.3.1 push.
- Symptoms: TypeScript strict mode flagged `recordings` in `RecentRecordings.tsx` line 91 as "declared but its value is never read", causing all platform builds to exit with code 1.
- Root cause: the `recordings` read side of `useState` was kept during the cache refactor even though rendering uses the pre-grouped `groups` state and mutations use the functional-update form of `setRecordings`.
- Solution: changed `const [recordings, setRecordings]` to `const [, setRecordings]` to omit the unused read binding.
- Validation: TypeScript diagnostics clean; pushed as v1.3.2.

### 2026-04-23 - Recent Recordings cache with background refresh

- Request: avoid blocking every time Recent Recordings is revisited by caching the last loaded list, then refreshing in the background and updating only when new items or feed changes are detected.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - Recent Recordings remounted on route changes and always re-ran the initial fetch before showing content.
  - The list felt blocking even when the user had just visited it moments earlier.
  - Initial cache hydration done in `useEffect` still delayed visible rendering until after mount, so the page could appear blank before the cached list appeared.
- Solution:
  - `RecentRecordings.tsx`: added a per-server in-memory cache keyed by active server and server-change version.
  - Cached recordings and channel logos now initialize component state synchronously during the first render, so revisiting the page paints immediately from cache.
  - A background refresh still runs on every visit; it updates the visible list only if newer recordings are present or the feed order/content changed.
  - Trash actions now update the cache immediately so revisiting the page does not re-show deleted items.
  - To reduce mount cost, the page now renders only about three day groups initially and appends older groups as the user scrolls near the bottom.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified file.

### 2026-04-23 - Progressive list rendering for Live, TV Shows, and Movies

- Request: apply the same quick-initial-render behavior to Live, TV Shows, and Movies lists.
- Rationale: reduce mount-time DOM cost for large lists by rendering an initial slice, then appending older items during scroll.
- Solution:
  - `Live.tsx`: render an initial subset of filtered/sorted channel rows and append more near list bottom.
  - `TVShows.tsx`: render an initial subset of sorted shows in the sidebar and append more on scroll; keep selected/deep-linked show visible by expanding the slice when needed.
  - `Movies.tsx`: render an initial subset of movie cards in list view and append more as the page scroll nears the bottom.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified files.

### 2026-04-23 - Cache-first route revisit rendering for Live, TV Shows, and Movies

- Request: remove perceptible delay when navigating back to Live, TV Shows, and Movies (especially on higher-latency remote server connections).
- Symptoms discovered:
  - each page still waited on fresh network responses before list rendering, unlike Recent Recordings.
  - delay was much more visible when using the Hawaii server.
- Solution:
  - `Live.tsx`, `TVShows.tsx`, `Movies.tsx`: added per-server in-memory caches and cache-first state initialization so the previous list paints immediately on revisit.
  - Each page still performs a background refresh and updates the visible list when fresh data arrives.
  - Existing progressive list slicing remains in place to reduce mount-time DOM work.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified files.

### 2026-04-23 - Persisted sort selections with field-based default direction

- Request: persist sort selections across sessions and use default direction rules: ascending for alphabetical sorts; descending for ID and date sorts.
- Solution:
  - `Live.tsx`: persisted live list and diagnostics sort mode selections.
  - `TVShows.tsx`, `Movies.tsx`, `Library.tsx`: persisted sort field + direction selections via localStorage.
  - Sort field changes now reset direction using field defaults (`title` → ascending, `id`/`date-*` → descending), while still allowing user override via arrow controls.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified files.

### 2026-04-23 - Preserve Search criteria across server switches

- Request: keep search criteria/results when switching servers.
- Solution:
  - `Search.tsx`: removed server-switch clearing logic so `keyword` and `submittedKeyword` persist across server changes.
  - Existing behavior remains: users can clear manually via the clear action.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified file.

### 2026-04-23 - Resizable split lists and non-jumping divider drag

- Request: keep the default sort direction visibly selected on first render and make split-view list columns resizable like Recent Recordings, without the drag-jump quirk.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - Recent Recordings resize used absolute mouse X for width, which caused the divider to jump when the drag started away from the exact sidebar edge.
  - TV Shows and Library split views had fixed-width list panes.
- Solution:
  - Added `useResizableSidebar` to compute width from drag delta (`startWidth + currentX - startX`) so resizing tracks smoothly from the initial click point.
  - `RecentRecordings.tsx`: switched to the shared resize hook, removing the divider jump.
  - `TVShows.tsx` and `Library.tsx`: added the same resizable sidebar behavior and splitter handle used by Recent Recordings.
  - Added `aria-pressed` on active sort direction buttons so the default sort direction is explicitly marked active from initial render.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified files.

### 2026-04-23 - Sort direction switched to stacked up/down triangle buttons

- Request: replace the single direction toggle with two vertically stacked triangle buttons (up and down).
- Rationale: explicit direction controls are faster to scan and avoid ambiguous toggle state.
- Solution:
  - `TVShows.tsx`, `Movies.tsx`, `Library.tsx`: replaced each single sort-order toggle with a two-button stack that sets `asc` and `desc` directly.
  - `Page.css`: added `.page-sort-order-stack` plus button variants/active styling for compact stacked triangle controls.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified files.

### 2026-04-23 - Added Date Updated and separate sort direction toggle

- Request: add `Date Updated` to sort options and use a separate asc/desc control next to each sort dropdown instead of encoding direction in dropdown choices.
- Rationale: cleaner sort model and easier direction changes without reopening the field menu.
- Solution:
  - `TVShows.tsx`, `Movies.tsx`, `Library.tsx`: sort dropdowns now select field only (`Title`, `ID`, `Date Added`, `Date Updated`) and a dedicated adjacent button toggles direction (`↑`/`↓`).
  - `Page.css`: added shared `.page-sort-order-btn` styles and updated side-list sort row layout to place dropdown and toggle on the same line.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for all modified files.

### 2026-04-23 - Unified dropdown sorting with ID and created-date options

- Request: revert date behavior to created-date sorting and replace sort buttons with dropdowns that include ID and Date Added options across all sortable views.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - toggle-button sorting made it harder to discover all sort modes.
  - previous show-level date behavior using `last_recorded_at` did not match expected results.
- Solution:
  - `TVShows.tsx`: replaced show/episode sort buttons with dropdowns; added `ID` and `Date Added` options (plus title A-Z/Z-A); date sorts now use `created_at` ordering.
  - `Movies.tsx`: replaced sort buttons with dropdown containing title/ID/date-added options; date-added uses `created_at` ordering.
  - `Library.tsx`: expanded existing dropdowns (group and video) to include title/ID/date-added options and ascending/descending variants.
  - `types.ts`: removed temporary `last_recorded_at` typing from `Show` after reverting strategy.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for all modified files.

### 2026-04-22 - Date sort aligned to Date Added semantics

- Request: clarify and correct date sort behavior to better match Channels' Date Added expectations.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - UI labels said `Date`, which was ambiguous against Date Added / Date Updated / Date Released terminology in Channels tools.
  - TV show list date ordering could feel wrong when series were sorted by `created_at` only.
- Solution:
  - `TVShows.tsx`: renamed date sort labels to `Date Added` (show list and episode list).
  - TV show date sort now prefers `last_recorded_at`, then falls back to `created_at`, then `updated_at`.
  - Episode date sort uses `created_at` with fallback to `updated_at`.
  - `Movies.tsx`: renamed date sort label to `Date Added` (behavior remains `created_at`-based).
  - `types.ts`: added optional `last_recorded_at` to `Show` type for API parity.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified files.

## v1.3.0 — 2026-04-22

### 2026-04-22 - Search UI polish: icons and inline clear button

- Request: add icons to Search, Trash, and Mark as Not Recorded buttons; move the ✕ clear button inside the search textbox on the right edge; style it red.
- Rationale: visual affordance for destructive/utility actions; inline clear button follows common browser/address-bar pattern.
- Solution:
  - `Search.tsx`: wrapped input in `.search-panel__input-wrap` (relative container); absolutely positioned `.search-panel__clear-btn` at right edge; button only renders when keyword is non-empty.
  - Added 🔍 prefix to Search button text.
  - `RecordingDetail.tsx`: added 🗑️ prefix to Trash button and ✕ prefix to Mark as Not Recorded button.
  - `Page.css`: `.search-panel__input-wrap` sets `position: relative`; `.search-panel__clear-btn` uses `position: absolute; right: 8px; z-index: 1` with no background/border; input gets `z-index: 0` so button overlays it. `padding-right: 36px` keeps text clear of the button.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean.

### 2026-04-22 - Search persistence, clear action, and series-first ordering

- Request: keep search results when navigating away/back, add a clear-search button, and order results with matching series first then episodes by created date.
- Rationale: users often inspect multiple hits by navigating to details and returning; rerunning the query each time is friction.
- Solution:
  - `Search.tsx`: persisted `keyword`, `submittedKeyword`, and `searchType` to localStorage and restored them on page mount.
  - Added Clear button (`✕`) beside Search to reset keyword and results quickly.
  - Updated result ordering to rank by type (`TV Series` first, then `TV Episode`, then `Movie`, then `Video`) and sort within each type by `created_at` descending.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified file.

### 2026-04-22 - Explicit Enter key execution for Search

- Request: ensure pressing Enter in the Search textbox executes the search.
- Rationale: keyboard-first flow should not depend only on button clicks.
- Solution:
  - `Search.tsx`: added explicit `onKeyDown` handling on the keyword input to execute search when Enter is pressed.
  - Search form submit behavior remains in place; this makes Enter execution explicit and reliable.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified file.

### 2026-04-22 - Search UX: explicit Search button and episode title matching for Title mode

- Request: stop incremental filtering; execute search only on explicit action, but re-run when search type changes. Also fix Title mode so an episode with matching `episode_title` is returned.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - keyword typing updated results immediately (incremental behavior).
  - `Title` mode did not return episodes when only `episode_title` matched (for example: "One Last Call").
- Solution:
  - `Search.tsx`: introduced `submittedKeyword` state so results are computed from the last executed keyword.
  - Added a Search button and submit handler; Enter key now submits via form.
  - Added auto re-execute on search-type change by re-submitting the current keyword when radio selection changes.
  - Updated TV episode Title-mode matching to include both `title` and `episode_title`.
  - `Page.css`: added `.search-panel__input-row` layout for textbox + Search button.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified files.

### 2026-04-22 - Show file path in episode and movie details

- Request: add the recording file path to the episode details page and movie detail page.
- Rationale: path visibility helps with troubleshooting source files and share-path mapping.
- Solution:
  - `RecordingDetail.tsx`: added a dedicated `Path: ...` line in the episode/recording detail body.
  - `Movies.tsx`: added a dedicated `Path: ...` line in movie details and removed duplicate `path` from the generic attributes list.
  - `Page.css`: added `.rec-detail__path` and `.media-detail__path` styles with wrapping for long paths.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for modified files.

### 2026-04-22 - Add cross-library Search page with typed matching and result navigation

- Request: add a Search page in the main menu (above Settings) with a keyword textbox, search-type radio options, and a persistent results table. Support targets: `show_id`, `program_id`, title fields, and summary fields, with a special series-name mode.
- Rationale: users need a direct way to find recordings and library items by IDs and text metadata, then jump straight to the relevant detail view.
- Solution:
  - Added `/search` route and Sidebar navigation item.
  - Added new `Search.tsx` page that loads shows, episodes, movies, and videos, then filters by search type:
    - Any: matches across ID/title/summary text fields (excludes season/episode numbers as requested).
    - Title: matches only `title`.
    - Summary: matches `summary` and `full_summary`.
    - Series Name: resolves matching show names, then returns rows for those series plus episodes whose `show_id` maps to matched series.
  - Added persistent results table columns: Type, Created Date, Modified Date, Title, Episode Title, Summary, Full Summary.
  - Added row-click navigation targets:
    - TV Episode -> `/tv?showId=...&episodeId=...`
    - TV Series -> `/tv?showId=...`
    - Movie -> `/movies?movieId=...`
    - Video -> `/library?groupId=...&videoId=...`
  - Added deep-link query handling:
    - `TVShows.tsx` now supports `episodeId` preselection after loading show episodes.
    - `Movies.tsx` now supports `movieId` preselection.
    - `Library.tsx` now supports `groupId` and `videoId` preselection/highlight.
  - Added Search-specific styles to `Page.css` for form controls and table layout.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean across all modified files.

### 2026-04-22 - Use created date for TV show/episode Date sort

- Request: stop sorting TV shows/episodes by modified timestamp for the Date sort; use created date instead.
- Rationale: modified timestamps can drift from recording chronology and produced ordering that did not match user expectations.
- Solution:
  - Updated `TVShows.tsx` Date sort logic for show list and episode list to use `created_at` instead of `updated_at`.
  - Preserved existing sort toggle behavior and Date label.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for updated file.

## v1.2.2 — 2026-04-21

### 2026-04-21 - Sort toggle buttons; Live TV title wrap fix

- Request: replace sort dropdowns with toggle buttons showing sort direction; clicking the active sort reverses it; rename "Date Added" to "Date". Prevent "Live TV" heading from wrapping when source filter buttons overflow.
- Rationale: toggle buttons are more compact and discoverable; ▲/▼ arrows eliminate ambiguity about sort order. The heading wrap was a cosmetic regression when many sources are configured.
- Solution:
  - `TVShows.tsx`: added `showSortOrder` and `episodeSortOrder` state; replaced both `<select>` controls with paired `sort-btn` buttons; sort `useMemo` respects direction.
  - `Movies.tsx`: same pattern with `sortOrder` state.
  - `Page.css`: added `.sort-btn` and `.sort-btn--active` rules matching `.filter-btn` family.
  - `Live.tsx`: added `whiteSpace: nowrap` and `alignSelf: flex-start` to the `<h1>`.
- Validation: TypeScript diagnostics clean on all modified files.

## v1.2.1 — 2026-04-21

### 2026-04-21 - Gate "Mark as Not Recorded" on DVR rule association

- Request: "Mark as Not Recorded" only makes sense for recordings created by a DVR pass/rule. Disable the button for manually-recorded or otherwise unassociated files.
- Rationale: the action removes the program record so the DVR can re-record it — meaningless unless a rule is watching for it. Showing it unconditionally would confuse users.
- Solution:
  - Added `DvrFile` interface to `types.ts` with `ID`, `RuleID`, and companion fields from the `/dvr/files/{id}` response.
  - Added `fetchDvrFile(id)` to `recordings.ts` that GETs `/dvr/files/{id}`.
  - In `TVShows.tsx`: added `selectedEpisodeRuleId` state and a `selectEpisode(ep)` helper that calls `setSelectedEpisode` then fires `fetchDvrFile` in the background, updating `selectedEpisodeRuleId` on resolve. `onMarkNotRecorded` is now only passed when both `selectedEpisodeRuleId` is non-empty and `program_id` is present.
  - In `RecentRecordings.tsx`: same pattern with `selectedRuleId` state and `selectRecording(rec)` helper. State is also cleared on server reload (`useEffect` dependency on `serverChangeVersion`).
  - The `fetchDvrFile` call is fire-and-forget from the user's perspective — the button simply appears after the detail pane loads, with no visible loading state.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean across all modified files.

### 2026-04-21 - Trash and Mark as Not Recorded actions on episode detail

- Request: add two mutation buttons to the episode/recording detail pane — "Trash" (permanently delete the file) and "Mark as Not Recorded" (remove the program record so the DVR can re-record it).
- Rationale: common DVR housekeeping tasks; the curl equivalents are `DELETE /dvr/files/{id}` and `DELETE /dvr/programs/{program_id}`.
- Solution:
  - Added `trashRecording(id)` (`DELETE /dvr/files/{id}`) and `markAsNotRecorded(programId)` (`DELETE /dvr/programs/{programId}`) to `src/api/recordings.ts` using the existing `runMutationCandidates` plumbing.
  - Added `program_id?: string` to `RecordingDetailItem` so callers can pass the EPxxxxxx identifier.
  - Added `onTrash` and `onMarkNotRecorded` optional callback props to `RecordingDetail`; the Trash button wraps its callback in a `window.confirm` to prevent accidental deletion.
  - Added `.rec-detail__actions` flex container and `.rec-detail__action-btn--secondary` / `--danger` styles to `Page.css`.
  - `TVShows.tsx`: added `handleTrashEpisode` and `handleMarkNotRecorded` handlers that call the API, optimistically remove the episode from the list, and deselect it on success. Both respect the `apiVersionApproved` guard.
  - `RecentRecordings.tsx`: same handlers; added `actionError` state displayed above the detail pane; wired `apiVersionApproved` from the store.
  - `onMarkNotRecorded` is only passed when `program_id` is present on the item.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean across all modified files.

### 2026-04-21 - API version guard: block write actions on server update

- Request: Channels DVR occasionally ships breaking API changes. After a server update, mutations that worked before could produce unintended side effects. Implement a version check that blocks or warns about write actions until the user explicitly confirms the new version is safe.
- Rationale: The DVR API is undocumented and subject to change at any release. A silent break is worse than a visible prompt.
- Solution:
  - Added `fetchServerVersion(serverUrl)` to `client.ts` — hits `/api/v1/status` and extracts a version string. Returns `null` gracefully on any failure.
  - Extended `probeActiveServer()` in `useStore.ts` to fetch the version after a successful URL probe, then compare against a per-server approved version map stored in `localStorage` under `dvr_api_approved_versions`.
  - First connection to a server auto-approves the current version (no false alarm for new installs).
  - Added `apiVersion: string | null` and `apiVersionApproved: boolean` to store state; `approveApiVersion()` action saves the current version as approved for the active server.
  - `App.tsx` renders a persistent amber banner when `!probing && !apiVersionApproved`, with a link to Settings.
  - Settings page gains an "API Compatibility" section showing the detected version, approval status, and an "Approve v{version}" button.
  - `TVShows.toggleWatched` and `Movies.toggleWatched` check `apiVersionApproved` and surface an inline error rather than calling the API when blocked.
  - VideoPlayer automatic playback-position writeback is intentionally not blocked — it is low-risk and blocking it mid-playback would be disruptive.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean across all six modified files.

### 2026-04-21 - Fix v1.2.0 CI build: MediaCard TypeScript errors

- Request: v1.2.0 GitHub Actions release workflow failed on all four targets.
- Symptoms: 36 TypeScript errors across all build jobs; `completed` prop used in component body and passed by callers but missing from `MediaCardProps`; unused destructured params (`id`, `commercials`, `filePath`, `recordingKind`) and unused `useStore` import caused `noUnusedLocals` errors.
- Root cause: the "Restore flags/badges" commit (2026-04-20) added `completed={…}` to `MediaCard` callers and used it inside the component but forgot to declare `completed?: boolean` in `MediaCardProps`, and left no-longer-needed destructured params in the function signature.
- Solution:
  - Added `completed?: boolean` to `MediaCardProps` interface.
  - Removed `useStore` import (unused since RecordingDetail extraction).
  - Removed `id`, `commercials`, `filePath`, `recordingKind` from the function destructuring (still in the interface; callers may pass them).
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean across `MediaCard.tsx`, `TVShows.tsx`, `Movies.tsx`.

### 2026-04-21 - MediaCard badge row wraps instead of scrolling

- Request: episode/movie cards with many badges were showing a horizontal scrollbar; wrap to a second line instead.
- Solution:
  - Changed `.media-card__badges` from `flex-wrap: nowrap; overflow-x: auto` to `flex-wrap: wrap` and removed the overflow scroll.
  - Tightened gap from `6px` to `4px` so wrapped rows stay compact.
- Validation:
  - CSS-only change; TypeScript diagnostics unaffected.

### 2026-04-21 - Fix Tailscale fallback: block page mounts until probe resolves

- Request: app would not load content when launched off-LAN even with a Tailscale URL configured.
- Symptoms: pages fetched data immediately on mount using the LAN URL before the async probe had a chance to switch to Tailscale, causing all API calls to fail.
- Root causes:
  1. Route components mounted and fired `useEffect` data fetches before `probeActiveServer()` finished.
  2. `probeActiveServer` did not increment `serverChangeVersion` when switching to Tailscale, so pages already mounted would not retry.
- Solution:
  - `App.tsx` now tracks a `probing` boolean; while `true`, routes are replaced with a "Connecting…" placeholder so no page mounts until the correct URL is confirmed.
  - `probeActiveServer` in `useStore.ts` now increments `serverChangeVersion` alongside `serverUrl` when switching to the Tailscale address, triggering a re-fetch on any mounted page.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean across `App.tsx` and `useStore.ts`.

### 2026-04-20 - Restore flags/badges on TV Shows and Movies cards

- Request: badge indicators (favorited, delayed, cancelled, interrupted, content rating, tags) were not appearing on episode or movie cards.
- Symptoms: cards showed no badges at all despite the data being present on the API objects.
- Root cause: `MediaCard` calls in `TVShows.tsx` and `Movies.tsx` passed neither `badges` nor `completed` props; the earlier refactoring that removed the show-attributes modal did not re-add the badge-building logic.
- Solution:
  - Added `epBadges(ep)` helper to `TVShows.tsx` mirroring the flags shown in `RecordingDetail`.
  - Added `movieBadges(movie)` helper to `Movies.tsx` with identical logic.
  - Both `MediaCard` calls now pass `badges={…}` and `completed={…}` instead of the legacy single `badge` prop.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean across both page files.

### 2026-04-20 - Tailscale dual-address support with automatic LAN probe

- Request: support two addresses per server (LAN + Tailscale); on startup probe which is reachable and use LAN if available, Tailscale otherwise.
- Rationale: users run Channels DVR on a home LAN but also need remote access via Tailscale; the app should auto-select the best URL without manual intervention.
- Solution:
  - Added optional `tailscaleUrl` field to `ServerOption` in `useStore.ts` and `parseServers`.
  - Added `probeUrl(url, timeoutMs)` to `client.ts` — uses `Promise.race` to enforce a 2.5 s timeout; returns `true` if any HTTP response is received (even 4xx), `false` on network error or timeout.
  - Added `probeActiveServer()` async action to the store — probes the LAN URL, switches `serverUrl` (and `dvr_server_url` in localStorage) to the Tailscale address if LAN is unreachable; falls back to LAN if neither responds.
  - Added a "Tailscale URL" column to the Settings servers table (optional, validated only if non-empty).
  - `testConnection` in Settings now probes LAN first and reports which address was used (LAN / Tailscale) when testing.
  - `App.tsx` calls `probeActiveServer()` on mount and whenever `activeServerId` changes.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean across all four modified files.

### 2026-04-20 - Extract shared RecordingDetail component

- Request: episode detail page in TV Shows should be the identical component rendered in Recent Recordings, not a similar-looking duplicate.
- Rationale: the two pages were maintaining separate but functionally identical JSX for the detail pane, causing divergence and confusion.
- Solution:
  - Created `src/components/RecordingDetail.tsx` with a `RecordingDetailItem` interface satisfied by both `Recording` and `Episode`.
  - Component accepts `onPlay`, optional `onBack`/`backLabel`, and optional `onNavigateToShow` (renders "View all episodes" link only when provided).
  - `RecentRecordings` now renders `<RecordingDetail>` with `onNavigateToShow` pointing to `/tv?showId=…`.
  - `TVShows` now renders `<RecordingDetail>` with `onBack` returning to the series view; no "View all episodes" link (already on that page).
  - Removed all duplicate inline detail JSX from both pages.
  - Removed dead helpers from TVShows (`labelKey`, `formatValue`, `showAttributes`, `formatDateTime`, `formatDuration`, `getServerUrl` import) that were only used by the now-deleted show-attributes modal.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean across all three files.

- Request: simplify TV Shows layout to two levels: (1) select show → see series image + description + episode grid; (2) click episode → episode detail view identical to RecentRecordings, with a back button.
- Rationale: previous layout had three side-by-side columns (show list, episode grid, detail pane) which was cramped and confusing; user wanted a single detail at a time.
- Solution:
  - `page__content` now has three conditional branches: episode detail view, series detail view, empty state.
  - Episode detail view reuses all `rec-detail__*` CSS classes and adds a `← Back to episodes` button calling `setSelectedEpisode(null)`.
  - Series detail view shows series image + description in a `tv-series-info` flex row, then the episode grid.
  - Removed third `ep-detail-panel` column entirely.
  - Removed `showMetaOpen` state and the show-attributes modal.
  - Removed `useNavigate` (unused), removed auto-select of first episode on show load.
  - Added `.tv-back-btn` and `.tv-series-info` CSS classes.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean.

- Request: clicking an episode card in the TV Shows page should show the same rec-detail panel used in Recent Recordings.
- Rationale: the episode grid gave no visual feedback when a card was clicked because `setSelectedEpisode` was called but no detail UI was rendered; the user expected the identical layout to Recent Recordings.
- Root cause: `selectedEpisode` state was updated on click but the JSX had no conditional branch rendering episode details.
- Solution:
  - Added a third flex column (`ep-detail-panel`) to the `page--split` layout in TVShows.tsx, rendered when `selectedEpisode !== null`.
  - Pane reuses all `rec-detail__*` CSS classes from Page.css (thumbnail, progress bar, meta badges, description, genres).
  - Added `useNavigate`, `getServerUrl`, `formatDateTime`, and `formatDuration` to TVShows.tsx.
  - Added `.ep-detail-panel` CSS class (fixed 360 px column, left border, independent scroll).
  - Empty-state placeholder shown when a show is selected but no episode has been clicked.
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean; no errors in TVShows.tsx or Page.css.

### 2026-04-17 - TV shows filter URL persistence

- Request: persist TV Shows `All`/`Unwatched` filter across refresh and navigation.
- Rationale: users should not lose filter context when reloading or navigating back to the TV Shows page.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - filter state was local-only and reset to `All` on page reload
- Solution:
  - wired TV Shows filter to `filter` query param using `useSearchParams`
  - hydrating component state from URL and updating the URL when filter changes
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for updated page; production build run after update

### 2026-04-17 - TV episode unwatched filter and recent-list progress indicators

- Request: add All/Unwatched filtering on TV Shows page; keep Recent Recordings unfiltered but show playback progress bars.
- Rationale: watched-state workflows should match Movies for episodic browsing, while recent recordings should surface resume progress without additional filter complexity.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - TV Shows page only exposed sorting and lacked watched-state filtering controls
  - Recent Recordings list did not visualize partial playback despite available `playback_time`
- Solution:
  - added `All` and `Unwatched` filter controls to the TV Shows episode grid, integrated with existing sort behavior
  - added slim per-item progress bars to Recent Recordings list rows when `playback_time > 0` and item is not watched
- Validation:
  - production build succeeds after updates

### 2026-04-17 - HAR-confirmed unwatch mutation contract

- Request: confirm and wire the inverse watched mutation using a dedicated unwatch HAR capture.
- Rationale: previous implementation used a fallback set for unwatch pending evidence of the exact server route.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - broad fallback variants for unwatch were no longer necessary after capture-driven endpoint discovery
- Solution:
  - switched unwatched action to exact `PUT /dvr/files/:id/unwatch` route with empty body
  - retained watched action as `PUT /dvr/files/:id/watch`
- Validation:
  - HAR parse confirms `PUT /dvr/files/65740/unwatch` returned `200`; production build run after code update

### 2026-04-17 - HAR-confirmed watched and playback-time mutations

- Request: replace endpoint guessing with exact mutation contracts captured from Channels web client HAR traces.
- Rationale: runtime probing was noisy and unreliable; captured traffic now provides definitive request paths.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - watched writes only succeeded in web client via a specific DVR route shape
  - playback resume writes used a path-parameter endpoint rather than JSON/form payload mutation
- Solution:
  - switched watched-on mutation to `PUT /dvr/files/:id/watch` (empty body)
  - switched playback position writeback to `PUT /dvr/files/:id/playback_time/:seconds` (empty body)
  - kept a small unwatch fallback set pending a dedicated HAR capture for the inverse action
- Validation:
  - TypeScript diagnostics clean for updated API module; production build validation run after change

### 2026-04-17 - Watched toggle and resume-progress writeback prototype

- Request: evaluate feasibility of watched/unwatched and resume playback state updates for recordings.
- Rationale: current app consumed read-only DVR API fields (`watched`, `playback_time`) but offered no UI write path.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - API client only supported `GET` calls
  - playback start did not seek to saved `playback_time`
  - no mutation controls existed in movie/episode card UI
- Solution:
  - added mutation-capable API helper (`requestWithMethod`) and recording update wrappers with fallback endpoint/payload shapes
  - added watched/unwatched action button on `MediaCard` and wired it into Movies and TV Shows pages with optimistic UI + rollback on failure
  - extended playback store state to carry recording kind and resume time
  - updated player to seek to saved resume point and periodically attempt playback-time + watched writeback for episode/movie playback
- Validation:
  - TypeScript/Problems check run after edits; remaining verification requires live DVR endpoint confirmation for undocumented mutation routes

### 2026-04-17 - Playback diagnostics exposes winning mutation endpoint

- Request: show which write endpoint shape succeeds so undocumented API discovery is visible in-app.
- Rationale: endpoint guessing should be auditable during real playback/testing runs.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - write helpers attempted multiple candidate routes but success path was only visible in logs
- Solution:
  - tracked last successful mutation candidate in recording API helper
  - added `Last Mutation` row to player diagnostics panel and playback report output
- Validation:
  - local build passes; runtime confirmation requires exercising watched/resume actions against a live DVR server

### 2026-04-17 - Expanded writeback endpoint probes after 404 diagnostics

- Request: investigate `No compatible mutation endpoint found` failures when marking movies watched.
- Rationale: initial probes targeted only a narrow `/api/v1` shape and consistently returned `404`.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - watched toggle errors showed every attempted `/api/v1/movies/:id` mutation variant failing with `404`
  - `Last Mutation` remained `n/a`, indicating no successful write path discovered
- Solution:
  - expanded mutation candidates to include likely `/dvr/files/:id` and related `/watch`, `/watched`, `/playback`, `/resume`, `/set` paths
  - added alternate payload key/value shapes (`true/false`, `1/0`, playback aliases)
  - added session-level unsupported-signature cache to avoid repeatedly spamming the same failed candidate set during periodic playback sync
- Validation:
  - local build and type checks pass; live endpoint discovery still required against actual DVR server behavior

### 2026-04-17 - Mutation failure telemetry and form-body probes

- Request: make failed writeback attempts easier to inspect and try a lower-level body format on the promising `/dvr/files/:id` route.
- Rationale: `PUT /dvr/files/:id` returned `503` while most other candidates returned `404`, suggesting the route may exist but expect a different request shape.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - user-facing error text became very long and hard to compare across attempts
  - diagnostics only exposed successful mutations, not the most recent failure cause
- Solution:
  - added `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` body support in the API client
  - added form-body variants for `/dvr/files/:id` and related set paths
  - exposed `Last Failure` alongside `Last Mutation` in player diagnostics and copied playback report output
- Validation:
  - local build passes; next live test should reveal whether form-encoded requests change the `/dvr/files/:id` response behavior

### 2026-04-16 - Version metadata bump to 1.1.8 for hidden-channel release

- Request: cut a new release version that includes the Live hidden-channel visibility option.
- Rationale: `v1.1.7` did not include commit `64efa75`; release installers must include the new setting.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - hidden-channel setting was present on `main` but not in `v1.1.7` tagged artifacts
- Solution:
  - bumped version metadata to `1.1.8` in `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`
  - prepared fresh `v1.1.8` tag from current `main`
- Validation:
  - local Problems check passes on changed files; tag release workflow will enforce version/tag parity

### 2026-04-16 - Live TV hidden-channel visibility setting

- Request: add a user option to hide/show channels that are marked hidden by source/DVR metadata in Live view.
- Rationale: hidden channels should not appear in normal Live browsing unless explicitly requested for diagnostics or edge cases.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - some users saw hidden HDHR/Channels DVR channels (including duplicates/SD/alternate language feeds) in Live list
- Solution:
  - added persisted app setting `showHiddenLiveChannels` (Settings -> Live TV -> Show hidden channels)
  - extended Live guide parsing to read hidden flags from guide channel metadata
  - added hidden-channel predicate that honors multiple API flag variants (`hidden`, `is_hidden`, `disabled`, `enabled=false`, `visible=false`) plus guide-hidden keys
  - applied hidden filter to the Live row set (affecting list, source counts, and diagnostics matrix) unless the new setting is enabled
- Validation:
  - local Problems check passes for touched files
  - change kept local per request; not pushed

### 2026-04-16 - Linux ARM64 AppImage bundling fix (`xdg-open`)

- Request: determine why Linux ARM64 failed and produce a corrected release.
- Rationale: ARM64 Linux artifact generation should fail only for real compile issues, not missing base tools in runner images.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - `Build (aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu)` failed in `Build Tauri app`
  - job logs showed `failed to bundle project xdg-open binary not found /usr/bin/xdg-open`
- Solution:
  - added `xdg-utils` to Linux dependency install step in release workflow
  - bumped release metadata to `1.1.7` across manifest files for a fresh, consistent tagged release
- Validation:
  - local Problems checks pass for updated workflow and version files; next tagged release run should include Linux ARM64 AppImage bundling prerequisites

### 2026-04-16 - v1.1.5 workflow failure recovery via version correction

- Request: fix release workflow failures after the new gating step blocked compilation.
- Rationale: the version gate should prevent mixed-version assets, but the next release tag must match manifests exactly so publishing can proceed.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - all `v1.1.5` build jobs failed in `Verify tag version matches manifests`
  - manifests were still `1.1.4` while the pushed tag was `v1.1.5`
- Solution:
  - bumped release-driving metadata to `1.1.6` in `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`
  - prepared next release to use a fresh matching tag rather than mutating the failed `v1.1.5` run again
- Validation:
  - local problems check to confirm updated files remain valid before retriggering release

### 2026-04-16 - Latest release pointer recovery and resilient release gating

- Request: ensure `/releases/latest` points to a release with install packages instead of stale source-only `v1.1.2`.
- Rationale: failed newer release runs should not prevent publishing valid installers and updating the latest release pointer.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - `v1.1.4` workflow failed in Windows verify step due shell-sensitive inline Node command
  - Linux ARM64 leg failure blocked publish job, leaving no newer release than `v1.1.2`
- Solution:
  - replaced inline verification commands with shared script `.github/scripts/verify-tag-version.mjs` used by Windows and Linux jobs
  - made Linux ARM64 matrix leg non-blocking (`continue-on-error` with `allow_failure: true`) so publish can proceed with available artifacts
- Validation:
  - local problems check passes; next tagged run should publish assets and advance latest release

### 2026-04-16 - Enforced build/version increment consistency

- Request: ensure build number increments on all release assets.
- Rationale: release tags and generated installer/package filenames must stay in sync to avoid mixed-version artifacts.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - previous tags could produce assets with older embedded app version when metadata had not been bumped first
- Solution:
  - bumped app version metadata from `1.1.3` to `1.1.4` in `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`
  - added release workflow gate in both Windows and Linux build jobs to verify `GITHUB_REF_NAME` tag version matches manifest versions before building
- Validation:
  - local problems check passes for updated files; next release tag will fail fast if version metadata is not incremented consistently

### 2026-04-16 - Linux release pipeline for x64 and ARM64

- Request: attempt Linux builds for x64 and ARM64 to support Debian/Ubuntu-style distributions.
- Rationale: publish native Linux install assets alongside Windows to broaden supported client platforms.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - existing release workflow only produced Windows (`msi`/`nsis`) artifacts
- Solution:
  - split release build jobs into `build-windows` and `build-linux`
  - added Linux matrix targets for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
  - installed required Linux Tauri build dependencies on runner
  - added Linux artifact upload (`.deb`, `.AppImage`) and expanded publish globs to include Linux assets
- Validation:
  - workflow syntax/Problems checks pass locally; release run required to confirm runner availability and resulting artifacts

### 2026-04-16 - Version metadata bump to 1.1.3 for installer filenames

- Request: ensure release installer filenames show `1.1.3` instead of `1.1.1`.
- Rationale: tagged release version and generated installer version should match for support and distribution clarity.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - `v1.1.3` release assets were published but filenames were still `WinChannels_1.1.1_...`
- Solution:
  - bumped version metadata to `1.1.3` in `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and root package entry in `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`
- Validation:
  - Problems check passes for updated files; ready for release rebuild via tag push

### 2026-04-16 - Release asset upload path fix

- Request: fix tagged releases that completed workflow runs but still showed source-only assets.
- Rationale: successful build jobs should always result in attached installer assets on the GitHub Release.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - latest `Release` workflow runs reported success across build/upload/download/publish steps
  - `v1.1.2` release still had zero attached assets
- Solution:
  - updated release publish globs to recursive patterns (`release-artifacts/**/*.msi`, `release-artifacts/**/*-setup.exe`) to match downloaded artifact subfolder layouts
  - added explicit artifact listing step before publish for visibility in workflow logs
- Validation:
  - workflow syntax/Problems checks pass locally; ready for retrigger on next tag

### 2026-04-16 - Release publish fix for source-only tag releases

- Request: resolve repeated release workflow failures where tagged releases showed only source archives.
- Rationale: installer assets must publish reliably for both x64 and ARM64 builds.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - `Publish GitHub Release` step failed with `Resource not accessible by integration` on release notes generation API
  - release page remained with source-only assets
- Solution:
  - updated release workflow to stop calling `generate_release_notes` and use explicit `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `softprops/action-gh-release`
- Validation:
  - workflow file updated; ready for retrigger via tag push

### 2026-04-15 - Fullscreen label and stats hotkey toggle corrections

- Request: fix fullscreen button text showing `Exit Fullscreen` at startup and make stats hotkey toggle persist instead of only while key is held.
- Rationale: diagnostics controls should accurately reflect state and behave predictably during playback.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - fullscreen control could render the exit label before entering fullscreen
  - stats overlay toggled on keydown and back off on keyup, causing press-and-hold behavior
- Solution:
  - changed overlay fullscreen state check to require a non-null fullscreen element match
  - removed keyup listener from stats hotkey path so `Shift+S` toggles only on keydown
- Validation:
  - TypeScript/Problems check reports no errors in updated files

### 2026-04-15 - Fullscreen-safe stats hotkey and player fullscreen control

- Request: make `Shift+S` reliably toggle stats while fullscreen.
- Rationale: native video fullscreen can intercept some keys before app-level handlers, causing diagnostics hotkeys to appear broken.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - even after expanding listeners, `Shift+S` still did not always fire when using native video fullscreen controls
- Solution:
  - hardened hotkey matching (`code === KeyS` with shift fallback to key value) and added capture listeners on window/document
  - added app-controlled fullscreen toggle on the player overlay so keyboard events stay inside app-managed DOM focus
  - focused overlay container on entering overlay fullscreen to keep shortcut handling reliable
- Validation:
  - TypeScript/Problems check reports no errors in updated files

### 2026-04-15 - Stats hotkey support in fullscreen playback

- Request: make the diagnostics stats hotkey work while video is in fullscreen mode.
- Rationale: fullscreen troubleshooting should not require exiting fullscreen to toggle diagnostics.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - `Shift+S` worked in windowed playback but could miss key events in fullscreen focus contexts
- Solution:
  - expanded key listeners from window-only to window + document capture + video element listeners
  - retained diagnostics-enabled and active-playback gating for shortcut behavior
- Validation:
  - TypeScript/Problems check reports no errors in updated files

### 2026-04-15 - Stats overlay keyboard toggle

- Request: add a keyboard shortcut for toggling player diagnostics stats.
- Rationale: quick in-playback toggling is faster than targeting a small header button during troubleshooting.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - stats overlay could only be toggled via mouse click
- Solution:
  - added `Shift+S` key handling in `VideoPlayer` when diagnostics tools are enabled and playback is active
  - updated the Stats button tooltip to document the shortcut
- Validation:
  - TypeScript/Problems check reports no errors in updated files

### 2026-04-15 - Player diagnostics "Stats for Nerds" overlay

- Request: add a YouTube-style in-player diagnostics view to inspect live playback performance and stream selection.
- Rationale: playback quality and stutter reports are easier to debug when stream/video telemetry is visible during playback, not only in copied logs.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - current diagnostics exposed only a copy-to-clipboard report and no live metrics view
  - users needed immediate visibility for bitrate estimate, selected level, buffering, and dropped-frame behavior
- Solution:
  - added a diagnostics-only `Stats` toggle in `VideoPlayer` header controls
  - implemented a live overlay panel updating every second with state, resolution, selected level, bandwidth estimate, buffer ahead, dropped/decoded frames, dropped-frame percentage, playback rate, volume, and manifest URL
  - extended copied playback report to include the same runtime metrics snapshot
  - updated Settings diagnostics hint text to describe the new overlay tool
- Validation:
  - TypeScript/Problems check reports no errors in changed files

### 2026-04-15 - Release workflow adds Windows ARM64 artifacts

- Request: publish Windows ARM64 installers in addition to existing x64 artifacts so Snapdragon users can install native builds.
- Rationale: release automation should ship both supported Windows architectures from tagged builds.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - local ARM64 build attempt failed on missing ARM64 MSVC cross tools (`cl.exe`/`clang` not found), indicating architecture-specific toolchain requirements
  - existing release workflow built only one default Windows target and uploaded only x64 paths
- Solution:
  - changed `.github/workflows/release.yml` to a matrix build for `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` and `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`
  - configured Rust setup with per-matrix target installation
  - uploaded per-target installer bundles as artifacts and added a single publish job that downloads and releases all installers together
- Validation:
  - workflow YAML updated with explicit per-target build commands and release file globs for both architectures

## Version 1.1.1 (2026-04-15)

### Fix duplicate channels in Favorites view

- Request: favorites list showed the same channel multiple times when it was present across multiple tuner sources.
- Rationale: `dedupeRows` was only applied for the `all` filter mode; the `favorites` filter left all per-source rows in the list.
- Solution: extended the `dedupeRows` call to also run when `filterMode === 'favorites'`.
- Validation: build passes; favorites view now shows each channel once.

### 2026-04-15 - Version bump to 1.1.0 for release parity

- Request: bump app version to `1.1` and ensure installer artifacts carry the same version.
- Rationale: shipped binaries and in-app/version metadata must stay aligned for supportability and release clarity.
- Solution:
  - updated `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` to `1.1.0`
  - prepared release by pushing matching git tag `v1.1.0` so CI-generated installers inherit the same version line
- Validation:
  - project build succeeds after version updates

### 2026-04-15 - Live diagnostics favorites and matching corrections

- Request: reduce false-positive favorites and align same channels (for example `TLC`) into the same comparison row across sources.
- Rationale: the diagnostics table should be trustworthy for source comparison and should not imply favorites that are not explicitly flagged by authoritative metadata.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - too many channels were marked favorite in Live diagnostics
  - same channel names could appear on separate rows across sources
- Solution:
  - tightened favorite detection to explicit channel/guide favorite flags only
  - changed diagnostics grouping key from channel number-only to normalized channel name
  - kept number/name sort controls while using representative minimum number for numeric ordering
- Validation:
  - build succeeds
  - same-name channels now align into shared rows across sources

### 2026-04-15 - Live source diagnostics matrix

- Request: add a diagnostics-only tool on Live showing a popup table of channels by source.
- Rationale: troubleshooting source differences (especially between similarly named sources) requires a single view that clearly shows channel membership per source instance.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - regular list filtering was useful for browsing but not ideal for side-by-side source inventory visibility
- Solution:
  - added a `Source Diagnostics` button on Live, shown only when diagnostics are enabled in settings
  - added modal with source-grouped channel tables including number, name, id, and favorite field state
- Validation:
  - build succeeds
  - diagnostics control is gated behind the existing diagnostics setting

### 2026-04-15 - Diagnostics matrix layout refactor

- Request: refactor diagnostics display to show sources across the top with channels listed in columns under each source.
- Rationale: source-by-source comparison is easier when all sources are aligned in one matrix rather than stacked as separate tables.
- Solution:
  - replaced per-source stacked tables with a single cross-source matrix keyed by channel number
  - sources are column headers and channel numbers are row headers
  - added diagnostics sort options for channel number and channel name
  - each cell stacks all matching entries for that source/number and shows logo, name, id, and favorite marker
- Validation:
  - build succeeds
  - matrix renders sources horizontally for direct comparison and keeps duplicate per-source matches visible within each cell

### 2026-04-15 - Live source split and favorites parity tuning

- Request: expose each real channel source instance separately at the top of Live (not merged by source name), while keeping `All Channels` and `Favorites` meta filters.
- Rationale: multiple HDHomeRun devices with the same source name can still differ in feed behavior, so source-instance visibility is needed for troubleshooting and comparison.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - source filters merged both HDHomeRun devices into one `HDHomeRun QUATRO` entry
  - some channels appeared as favorites in Channels UX context but were missing from Live favorites when `favorited` was absent in `/api/v1/channels`
- Solution:
  - changed source filters to use `source_name + source_id` labels (per-source-instance chips)
  - kept meta filters (`All Channels`, `Favorites`) as top-level options
  - expanded favorites detection to combine channel `favorited`, guide `Favorite` flags, and membership in `/dvr/guide/channels?source=favorites`
- Validation:
  - build succeeds
  - source chips now expose each real source instance separately
  - custom channels in the server favorites source can now be treated as favorites even when explicit flags are missing

### 2026-04-15 - VS Code build-task workflow approximation

- Request: approximate a Visual Studio-style Build menu experience in VS Code.
- Rationale: VS Code does not expose the same top-level Build menu model as Visual Studio, but default build tasks provide equivalent day-to-day behavior.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - F5 launch worked, but there was no obvious build-menu-style action
- Solution:
  - marked `WinChannels: Build` as the default build task in `.vscode/tasks.json`
  - this enables `Terminal -> Run Build Task...` and `Ctrl+Shift+B` for one-step builds
- Validation:
  - build task remains `npm run build` and continues to execute successfully

### 2026-04-15 - VS Code F5 launch configuration

- Request: make F5 start this project reliably from VS Code Run and Debug.
- Rationale: running through helper scripts worked, but F5 had no workspace launch configuration to invoke the app.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - pressing F5 did not start WinChannels debugging workflow
- Solution:
  - added `.vscode/launch.json` with a `node-terminal` launch profile that runs `npm run tauri dev`
  - added `.vscode/tasks.json` with named dev/build tasks for consistency
- Validation:
  - configuration files are present and valid JSON; project build remains successful

### 2026-04-15 - Convenience scripts for common commands

- Request: add root-level `run.cmd` and `build.cmd` wrappers for the common npm commands.
- Rationale: the full npm commands were easy to forget during routine local development.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - repeated need to recall or retype the exact dev and build commands
- Solution:
  - added `run.cmd` to call `npm run tauri dev`
  - added `build.cmd` to call `npm run build`
- Validation:
  - executed the build helper successfully

### 2026-04-15 - Live TV: source filters, dedupe, playback, logos

- Request: add a Live TV view with a list-style channel browser, sorting, filtering, and click-to-play behavior.
- Rationale: a list matched the existing TV Shows navigation model better than a dense guide grid and was sufficient for initial live playback support.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - initial list rows were inert because they had no play behavior
  - early filter rendering behaved incorrectly when duplicate channels were present
  - guessed live playback endpoints produced `manifestLoadError` 404s and `levelLoadError` 500s on some channels
  - custom 9000+ channels had no `logo_url` in the API even though Channels DVR web showed logos
- Solution:
  - added a Live page with channel sorting and filtering
  - changed source menus to use unique `source_name` values only
  - deduped the `All Channels` view while preserving source-specific filtering
  - resolved live playback against Channels DVR live HLS endpoints that match web playback behavior
  - centralized channel logo fallback logic using `station_id -> /tmsimg/assets/...`
  - added explicit list scrolling and kept duplicate-aware playback support
- Validation:
  - production build passes
  - live playback works with the verified `/devices/ANY/channels/{number}/hls` endpoint pattern
  - custom channel logos can be resolved from `station_id` fallback

### 2026-04-14 - TV and movie browsing UX refinement

- Request: make TV Shows and Movies behavior more consistent with Recent Recordings, then refine TV detail layout further.
- Rationale: the previous flows were inconsistent and exposed too much raw metadata in the TV detail view.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - TV details showed raw API output that was noisy and hard to scan
  - movie and TV navigation patterns differed more than necessary
- Solution:
  - reworked TV show list/detail flow to use artwork, summary, episode grid, and metadata popup
  - reworked movie browsing into a cleaner detail-first flow with back navigation
  - renamed Library to Videos for clearer navigation
- Validation:
  - UX changes were reviewed interactively and accepted during the session

### 2026-04-14 - Versioning, About page, and release wiring

- Request: surface version `1.0` in-app and make release packaging reflect it.
- Rationale: release builds and in-app UI needed a single visible version source for shipping and support.
- Solution:
  - bumped app, Tauri, and Rust package versions
  - added compile-time version constants and About section in Settings
  - ensured release workflow could publish tagged builds
- Validation:
  - tagged releases were created and pushed successfully

### 2026-04-14 - Playback quality investigation and remux preference

- Request: investigate blocky playback compared with Channels DVR web playback.
- Rationale: WinChannels should not force a visibly worse transcoding path than the native web client when the DVR can serve a better stream.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - DVR logs showed WinChannels requests triggering `h264_vaapi` while the web UI often used `remux`
  - HLS level selection was not reliably choosing the best variant
- Solution:
  - used absolute HLS URLs in Tauri contexts and routed playback through the Tauri HLS loader in dev and prod
  - added browser-like headers in the loader
  - added remux-preferred manifest requests with fallback to default manifests on load failure
  - switched level choice to highest bitrate rather than index order
  - added optional diagnostics and playback report capture
- Validation:
  - user confirmed playback quality improved and remux path activation was visible in DVR behavior

### 2026-04-14 - Multi-server support and connection diagnostics

- Request: support multiple DVR servers, allow switching in the sidebar, and test each configured server.
- Rationale: the app needed to work across several DVRs without editing config or restarting the app.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - connection tests initially used stale server state until settings were saved
  - server changes required restart-like behavior without an explicit refetch trigger
- Solution:
  - added persisted server table config with active-server selection
  - added sidebar dropdown for server choice
  - added server-change versioning to trigger refetch across pages
  - changed test flow to save first and then test all configured servers with per-server output
- Validation:
  - user reported all configured servers tested successfully

### 2026-04-14 - Tauri scope fix for non-default DVR ports

- Request: allow DVR access on ports other than `8089`.
- Rationale: the Tauri HTTP allow-list was too narrow and blocked legitimate DVR hosts on alternate ports.
- Symptoms discovered:
  - requests succeeded on `:8089` but failed on another DVR port due to scope restrictions
- Solution:
  - updated Tauri capability URL patterns to allow host + any port for HTTP and HTTPS
- Validation:
  - alternate-port DVR requests became reachable after the capability change
